FastTracks:
Interactive GUI allows automated tracking of fluorescently labeled cells and rapid computation of migratory statistics. 

Getting Started:
enter FastTracks at the MATLAB command promt to initiate the GUI.  Import a time-lapse movie of fluorescently labeled cells in an 8-bit TIFF file formate.  Set 4 mandatory parameters to generate cell trajectories in seconds.  Export migration statistics of cells for further data analysis. 

A step-by-step tutorial and sample images can be downloaded at MATLAB File Exchange (search author Brian DuChez).  Additionally a more indepth protocol for using the software has been published giving more indepth explaination and examples for all of the GUI features.
